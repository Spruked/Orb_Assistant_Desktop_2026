# A.I.M.S. Development Log

## 2026-09-13 — Initial repository

- Created and pushed root commit `1204914` to `Spruked/AIMS` on `main`.
- Established canonical product name: **A.I.M.S. — Agnostic Immutable Memory
  System**.

## 2026-09-13 — Trust and persistence repair

- Replaced transient Vault state with an append-only Vault event ledger and
  replay-based reconstruction.
- Added immutable ledger genesis policy, canonical hash material containing
  Glyph mode/key ID, authenticated HMAC Glyph chains, and runtime keyrings.
- Added historical key validation, key-rotation events, fail-closed startup,
  and cross-process Windows/POSIX writer locking.
- Added persistent A Priori, A Posteriori, and Collective indexes; SQLite
  retrieval receipts; loopback-only service defaults; no-default CORS; and
  remote token enforcement.
- Flattened the repository, added `pyproject.toml`, CI, and regression tests.
- Validation at this checkpoint: 11 regression tests passing, API smoke test,
  compile check, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-09-13 — Active cognitive-adaptation completion

- Verified the remaining v1 gaps: public retrieval aliases, exact retrieval
  snapshots, SKG edge lifecycle/merge, causal outcome evaluation, and adaptive
  retrieval ranking.
- Implemented forensic retrieval snapshots, canonical public retrieval modes,
  replayable SKG edge lifecycle, node merge evidence, causal outcome events,
  and persistent utility-informed ranking.
- Added and passed `test_complete_cognitive_memory_cycle`, proving retrieval →
  outcome → immutable evaluation → edge transition → changed persisted ranking
  after restart, with Vault and Glyph chains intact.
- Current validation: 12 regression/integration tests passing.

## 2026-09-13 — Licensing

- Added the Spruked proprietary and confidential software license.

## 2026-09-13 — Prototype freeze and v1 hardening contract

- Reclassified the current implementation as **v0.2.0 — Functional Prototype**.
- Corrected documentation that had implied completed cognitive architecture.
- Recorded measurable v0.3 through v1.0 requirements covering three-SKG
  domain isolation, epistemic authority, outcome evidence, hybrid retrieval,
  security, recovery, scale, inspection, anchoring, replication, and
  independent review.

## 2026-09-13 — v0.3 three-SKG and backend foundation

- Replaced the mixed-domain SKG with A Priori, A Posteriori, and Collective
  logical graph domains, routed only by Vault atom epistemic origin.
- Made graph mutation event-first: immutable Vault evidence is appended before
  derived graph state changes; a failed Vault event leaves graph state intact.
- Preserved `memory_core.skg` imports through a compatibility facade and moved
  long-term entry provenance out of SKG topology.
- Added the zero-dependency Python reference backend and optional GraphQLite
  derived-state mirror. GraphQLite was verified on Windows with Python 3.14
  using its current 0.8.0 wheel and a Cypher traversal probe.
